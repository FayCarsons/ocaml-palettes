# Shades - An OCaml color palette collection

Various R color palette packages reformatted for OCaml. Each collection of
palettes is a module inside the 'Palettes' module, allowing collections to be
explored via autocomplete.

The four collections currently available are `Met`, `PNW`, `WesAnderson`, and
`MexBrewer`

You can preview the palettes at https://faycarsons.github.io/shades-preview/

This library does not use any sort of versioning as it will likely not change,
and in the case it does palettes will be added but not removed.
