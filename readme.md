# Shades - An OCaml color palette collection

Various R color palette packages reformatted for OCaml. Each collection of palettes is a module inside the 'Palettes' module, allowing collections to be
explored via autocomplete. 

The four collections currently available are 'Met', 'PNW', 'WesAnderson', and 'MexBrewer'.

To preview palettes, clone the repo (or copy the HTML file in the root) and 
serve it locally.

This library does not use any sort of versioning as it will likely not change, 
and in the case it does palettees will be added but not removed.
